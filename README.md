# Linear-Regression-Model
This project contains machine learning algorithm that makes use of lineare regression for predicting weight of the brain based on the size of the head. It also contains regression plot that helps us understanding the relationship between dependent and independent variables visually. I had done this project for 'Data Analytics with Python' course offered by MyCaptain.
